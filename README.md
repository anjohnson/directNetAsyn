# Device Support for DirectNet PLCs via ASYN (directNetAsyn)

This [EPICS](https://epics-controls.org) device support module permits
EPICS IOCs to communicate with Automation Direct (Koyo) PLCs connected
through a serial port using
[asyn](https://epics-modules.github.io/asyn/).

The dnAsyn.html documentation included with the sources is also available
online [here](https://epics.anl.gov/modules/plc/directNet/dnAsyn.html).
